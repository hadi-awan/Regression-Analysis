# Regression-Analysis

## Linear Regression
In this part, I used Python to analyze the heart disease data set (the link and explanation is included here) by training and building a model with regression analysis. I tested my model and discussed the result of my test with performance metrics. Furthermore, I made sure that I separated training set and testing data properly. Then, I analysed the input data and explained which of them had more effects on output and modified my models by eliminating non significant variables. 

Heart Disease Dataset: Here, is the link for heart disease dataset of patients. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease. After going to this link you will find two folders: One: Data Folder and two: Dataset description. Data folder that has the dataset. It is better to use processed cleveland data. In the dataset description folder, you will find the description about the columnsâ€™ names referring to the 14 columns of the dataset as the following: The last one attribute (number 14) is the result. Here are the example of attributes and their Information (please see data set documents for more details).

1. #3 (age) 
2. #4 (sex) 
3. #9 (cp) 
4. #10 (trestbps) 
5. #12 (chol)
6. #16 (fbs) 
7. #19 (restecg) 
8. #32 (thalach) 
9. #38 (exang) 
10. #40 (oldpeak) 
......... 
13. #51 (thal)
14. #58 (num) --------------------------->result

## Logistic Regression

In this part, I used the heart disease data set to analyse the data with logistic regression analysis and compared my results with linear regression analysis, then answering which method is better. I first used two models as the estimator (with numerical result). I then compared both methods by calculating Errors such as Mean Square Error (MSE) and other performance metrics (R-squared) to find which method did prediction more accurately. I made sure to separate training set and testing data so that there was no overfitting.
